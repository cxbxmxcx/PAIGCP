              "'CHAPTER I.\\rDown the RabbitHole\\r\\r\\rAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\rbank, and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into\\rthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\rconversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought Alice\\rwithout pictures or conversations\\r\\rSo she was considering in her own mind as well as she could, for the\\rhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid, whether the pleasure of\\rmaking a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\rpicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\rclose by her.\\r\\rThere was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did Alice think it\\rso very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, Oh\\rdear! Oh dear! I shall be late! when she thought it over afterwards,\\rit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\rtime it all seemed quite natural but when the Rabbit actually took a\\rwatch out of its waistcoatpocket, and looked at it, and then hurried\\ron, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\rhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket, or a\\rwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\rfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\rlarge rabbithole under the hedge.\\r\\rIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\rin the world she was to get out again.\\r\\rThe rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\rdipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\rabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\rdeep well.\\r\\rEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\rplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\rwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\\rwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything then she\\rlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\rcupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures\\rhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\rpassed it was labelled ORANGE MARMALADE, but to her great\\rdisappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\rof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\rcupboards as she fell past it.\\r\\rWell! thought Alice to herself, after such a fall as this, I shall\\rthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave theyll all think me\\rat home! Why, I wouldnt say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\rtop of the house! Which was very likely true.\\r\\rDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end I wonder how\\rmany miles Ive fallen by this time she said aloud. I must be\\rgetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see that would\\rbe four thousand miles down, I think for, you see, Alice had learnt\\rseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\rthough this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her\\rknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\rpractice to say it over yes, thats about the right distancebut\\rthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Ive got to Alice had no\\ridea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\rgrand words to say.\\r\\rPresently she began again. I wonder if I shall fall right through\\rthe earth! How funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk\\rwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think she was rather\\rglad there was no one listening, this time, as it didnt sound at all\\rthe right word but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\rcountry is, you know. Please, Maam, is this New Zealand or Australia\\rand she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre\\rfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it And what\\ran ignorant little girl shell think me for asking! No, itll never do\\rto ask perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\\r\\rDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\rtalking again. Dinahll miss me very much tonight, I should think!\\rDinah was the cat. I hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at\\rteatime. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\\rno mice in the air, Im afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thats\\rvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder And here\\rAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\rdreamy sort of way, Do cats eat bats Do cats eat bats and\\rsometimes, Do bats eat cats for, you see, as she couldnt answer\\reither question, it didnt much matter which way she put it. She felt\\rthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\rwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\rNow, Dinah, tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly,\\rthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\rthe fall was over.\\r\\rAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment\\rshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead before her was another\\rlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\\rit. There was not a moment to be lost away went Alice like the wind,\\rand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, Oh my ears\\rand whiskers, how late its getting! She was close behind it when she\\rturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen she found\\rherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\rfrom the roof.\\r\\rThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked and when\\rAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\rdoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\rget out again.\\r\\rSuddenly she came upon a little threelegged table, all made of solid\\rglass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alices\\rfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall\\rbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\rbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\rtime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\rbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the\\rlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\r\\rAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\rmuch larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the\\rpassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\\rout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\rflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\rthrough the doorway and even if my head would go through, thought\\rpoor Alice, it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\\rhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\\rknew how to begin. For, you see, so many outoftheway things had\\rhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\\rindeed were really impossible.\\r\\rThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\rback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\rany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this\\rtime she found a little bottle on it, which certainly was not here\\rbefore, said Alice, and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\rlabel, with the words DRINK ME, beautifully printed on it in large\\rletters.\\r\\rIt was all very well to say Drink me, but the wise little Alice was\\rnot going to do that in a hurry. No, Ill look first, she said,\\rand see whether its marked poison or not for she had read\\rseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\\reaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\\rwould not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them\\rsuch as, that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long\\rand that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually\\rbleeds and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\\rbottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you,\\rsooner or later.\\r\\rHowever, this bottle was not marked poison, so Alice ventured to\\rtaste it, and finding it very nice, it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\\rflavour of cherrytart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and\\rhot buttered toast, she very soon finished it off.\\r\\r      \\r\\r      \\r\\r      \\r\\r\\rWhat a curious feeling! said Alice I must be shutting up like a\\rtelescope.\\r\\rAnd so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\rbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\rthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\\rwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further\\rshe felt a little nervous about this for it might end, you know,\\rsaid Alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\\rwonder what I should be like then And she tried to fancy what the\\rflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\\rnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\\r\\rAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\rinto the garden at once but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\\rdoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\rwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\rit she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\rbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery\\rand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\rsat down and cried.\\r\\rCome, theres no use in crying like that! said Alice to herself,\\rrather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute! She generally\\rgave herself very good advice, though she very seldom followed it,\\rand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\rher eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\rcheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\rfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\rBut its no use now, thought poor Alice, to pretend to be two\\rpeople! Why, theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable\\rperson!\\r\\rSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table\\rshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\rEAT ME were beautifully marked in currants. Well, Ill eat it, said\\rAlice, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key and if it\\rmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door so either way Ill\\rget into the garden, and I dont care which happens!\\r\\rShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, Which way Which\\rway, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\rgrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\rsize to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\rhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway\\rthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\\ron in the common way.\\r\\rSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\r\\r      \\r\\r      \\r\\r      \\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER II.\\rThe Pool of Tears\\r\\r\\rCuriouser and curiouser! cried Alice she was so much surprised, that\\rfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English now Im\\ropening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Goodbye, feet!\\rfor when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\rsight, they were getting so far off. Oh, my poor little feet, I\\rwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears Im\\rsure I shant be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\rmyself about you you must manage the best way you canbut I must be\\rkind to them, thought Alice, or perhaps they wont walk the way I\\rwant to go! Let me see Ill give them a new pair of boots every\\rChristmas.\\r\\rAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. They must\\rgo by the carrier, she thought and how funny itll seem, sending\\rpresents to ones own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\\r\\r Alices Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender, with\\r Alices love.\\r\\rOh dear, what nonsense Im talking!\\r\\rJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was\\rnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\rkey and hurried off to the garden door.\\r\\rPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\rlook through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more\\rhopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again.\\r\\rYou ought to be ashamed of yourself, said Alice, a great girl like\\ryou, she might well say this, to go on crying in this way! Stop\\rthis moment, I tell you! But she went on all the same, shedding\\rgallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\\rfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\\r\\rAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\rshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\rRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\\rin one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a\\rgreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, Oh! the Duchess, the\\rDuchess! Oh! wont she be savage if Ive kept her waiting! Alice felt\\rso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so, when the\\rRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, If you please,\\rsir The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\\rthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\r\\rAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\rkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking Dear, dear! How\\rqueer everything is today! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\\rI wonder if Ive been changed in the night Let me think was I the\\rsame when I got up this morning I almost think I can remember feeling\\ra little different. But if Im not the same, the next question is, Who\\rin the world am I Ah, thats the great puzzle! And she began\\rthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\\rherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\r\\rIm sure Im not Ada, she said, for her hair goes in such long\\rringlets, and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and Im sure I cant\\rbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\\rvery little! Besides, shes she, and Im I, andoh dear, how\\rpuzzling it all is! Ill try if I know all the things I used to know.\\rLet me see four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\\rand four times seven isoh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\\rrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesnt signify lets try\\rGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\\rRome, and Romeno, thats all wrong, Im certain! I must have been\\rchanged for Mabel! Ill try and say How doth the little and she\\rcrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\\rto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\\rdid not come the same as they used to do\\r\\rHow doth the little crocodile\\r Improve his shining tail,\\rAnd pour the waters of the Nile\\r On every golden scale!\\r\\rHow cheerfully he seems to grin,\\r How neatly spread his claws,\\rAnd welcome little fishes in\\r With gently smiling jaws!\\r\\r\\rIm sure those are not the right words, said poor Alice, and her eyes\\rfilled with tears again as she went on, I must be Mabel after all, and\\rI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\rno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, Ive\\rmade up my mind about it if Im Mabel, Ill stay down here! Itll be\\rno use their putting their heads down and saying Come up again, dear!\\rI shall only look up and say Who am I then Tell me that first, and\\rthen, if I like being that person, Ill come up if not, Ill stay down\\rhere till Im somebody elsebut, oh dear! cried Alice, with a sudden\\rburst of tears, I do wish they would put their heads down! I am so\\rvery tired of being all alone here!\\r\\rAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\rthat she had put on one of the Rabbits little white kid gloves while\\rshe was talking. How can I have done that she thought. I must be\\rgrowing small again. She got up and went to the table to measure\\rherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\\rnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon\\rfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\\rdropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\r\\rThat was a narrow escape! said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\rsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence and\\rnow for the garden! and she ran with all speed back to the little\\rdoor but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\\rkey was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than\\rever, thought the poor child, for I never was so small as this\\rbefore, never! And I declare its too bad, that it is!\\r\\rAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\rsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\\rshe had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case I can go back by\\rrailway, she said to herself. Alice had been to the seaside once in\\rher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\rto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\rsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\rof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station. However, she\\rsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\\rshe was nine feet high.\\r\\rI wish I hadnt cried so much! said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\rto find her way out. I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\rbeing drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be\\rsure! However, everything is queer today.\\r\\rJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\roff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought\\rit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\rshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\rslipped in like herself.\\r\\rWould it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this mouse\\rEverything is so outoftheway down here, that I should think very\\rlikely it can talk at any rate, theres no harm in trying. So she\\rbegan O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool I am very tired\\rof swimming about here, O Mouse! Alice thought this must be the right\\rway of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before, but\\rshe remembered having seen in her brothers Latin Grammar, A mouseof\\ra mouseto a mousea mouseO mouse! The Mouse looked at her rather\\rinquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\rbut it said nothing.\\r\\rPerhaps it doesnt understand English, thought Alice I daresay its\\ra French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror. For, with all\\rher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\ranything had happened. So she began again O est ma chatte which\\rwas the first sentence in her French lessonbook. The Mouse gave a\\rsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\\rfright. Oh, I beg your pardon! cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\\rhad hurt the poor animals feelings. I quite forgot you didnt like\\rcats.\\r\\rNot like cats! cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. Would\\ryou like cats if you were me\\r\\rWell, perhaps not, said Alice in a soothing tone dont be angry\\rabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah I think youd\\rtake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\\rquiet thing, Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\\rin the pool, and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\\rpaws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to\\rnurseand shes such a capital one for catching miceoh, I beg your\\rpardon! cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\\rover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. We wont talk\\rabout her any more if youd rather not.\\r\\rWe indeed! cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\rtail. As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always\\rhated cats nasty, low, vulgar things! Dont let me hear the name\\ragain!\\r\\rI wont indeed! said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\rconversation. Are youare you fondofof dogs The Mouse did not\\ranswer, so Alice went on eagerly There is such a nice little dog near\\rour house I should like to show you! A little brighteyed terrier, you\\rknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And itll fetch things when\\ryou throw them, and itll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\rof thingsI cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer, you\\rknow, and he says its so useful, its worth a hundred pounds! He says\\rit kills all the rats andoh dear! cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\\rIm afraid Ive offended it again! For the Mouse was swimming away\\rfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\\rpool as it went.\\r\\rSo she called softly after it, Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\rwont talk about cats or dogs either, if you dont like them! When the\\rMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face\\rwas quite pale with passion, Alice thought, and it said in a low\\rtrembling voice, Let us get to the shore, and then Ill tell you my\\rhistory, and youll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\\r\\rIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\rbirds and animals that had fallen into it there were a Duck and a\\rDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\\rled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER III.\\rA CaucusRace and a Long Tale\\r\\r\\rThey were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankthe\\rbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\rto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\r\\rThe first question of course was, how to get dry again they had a\\rconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\\rnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\\rshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\\rwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, I am\\rolder than you, and must know better and this Alice would not allow\\rwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\\rtell its age, there was no more to be said.\\r\\rAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\\rcalled out, Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! Ill soon make\\ryou dry enough! They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\\rMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\\rfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\\r\\rAhem! said the Mouse with an important air, are you all ready This\\ris the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! William\\rthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\\rto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\\raccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\\rMercia and Northumbria\\r\\rUgh! said the Lory, with a shiver.\\r\\rI beg your pardon! said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely Did\\ryou speak\\r\\rNot I! said the Lory hastily.\\r\\rI thought you did, said the Mouse. I proceed. Edwin and Morcar,\\rthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him and even\\rStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\\r\\rFound what said the Duck.\\r\\rFound it, the Mouse replied rather crossly of course you know\\rwhat it means.\\r\\rI know what it means well enough, when I find a thing, said the\\rDuck its generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\\rarchbishop find\\r\\rThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, found\\rit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\\rthe crown. Williams conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\\rof his Normans How are you getting on now, my dear it continued,\\rturning to Alice as it spoke.\\r\\rAs wet as ever, said Alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to\\rdry me at all.\\r\\rIn that case, said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, I move\\rthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\rremedies\\r\\rSpeak English! said the Eaglet. I dont know the meaning of half\\rthose long words, and, whats more, I dont believe you do either! And\\rthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds\\rtittered audibly.\\r\\rWhat I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone, was,\\rthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucusrace.\\r\\rWhat is a Caucusrace said Alice not that she wanted much to\\rknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to\\rspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\\r\\rWhy, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it. And,\\ras you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\\rtell you how the Dodo managed it.\\r\\rFirst it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, the exact\\rshape doesnt matter, it said, and then all the party were placed\\ralong the course, here and there. There was no One, two, three, and\\raway, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\\rliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\\rwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\\ragain, the Dodo suddenly called out The race is over! and they all\\rcrowded round it, panting, and asking, But who has won\\r\\rThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\\rthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\\rforehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\\rpictures of him, while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\\rsaid, Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.\\r\\rBut who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked.\\r\\rWhy, she, of course, said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\\rfinger and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\\rconfused way, Prizes! Prizes!\\r\\rAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\rpocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, luckily the salt water had\\rnot got into it, and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\\rone apiece, all round.\\r\\rBut she must have a prize herself, you know, said the Mouse.\\r\\rOf course, the Dodo replied very gravely. What else have you got in\\ryour pocket he went on, turning to Alice.\\r\\rOnly a thimble, said Alice sadly.\\r\\rHand it over here, said the Dodo.\\r\\rThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\\rpresented the thimble, saying We beg your acceptance of this elegant\\rthimble and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\\rcheered.\\r\\rAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\\rthat she did not dare to laugh and, as she could not think of anything\\rto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\\rshe could.\\r\\rThe next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and\\rconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\rtheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\rHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\\rbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\r\\rYou promised to tell me your history, you know, said Alice, and why\\rit is you hateC and D, she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\\rwould be offended again.\\r\\rMine is a long and a sad tale! said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\\rsighing.\\r\\rIt is a long tail, certainly, said Alice, looking down with wonder\\rat the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad And she kept on\\rpuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\\rtale was something like this\\r\\r Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, Let us both\\r go to law I will prosecute you.Come, Ill take no\\r denial We must have a trial For really this morning Ive\\r nothing to do. Said the mouse to the cur, Such a trial, dear\\r sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.\\r Ill be judge, Ill be jury, Said cunning old Fury Ill\\r try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.\\r\\rYou are not attending! said the Mouse to Alice severely. What are\\ryou thinking of\\r\\rI beg your pardon, said Alice very humbly you had got to the fifth\\rbend, I think\\r\\rI had not! cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\\r\\rA knot! said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\\ranxiously about her. Oh, do let me help to undo it!\\r\\rI shall do nothing of the sort, said the Mouse, getting up and\\rwalking away. You insult me by talking such nonsense!\\r\\rI didnt mean it! pleaded poor Alice. But youre so easily offended,\\ryou know!\\r\\rThe Mouse only growled in reply.\\r\\rPlease come back and finish your story! Alice called after it and\\rthe others all joined in chorus, Yes, please do! but the Mouse only\\rshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\\r\\rWhat a pity it wouldnt stay! sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\\rquite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\\rher daughter Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\ryour temper! Hold your tongue, Ma! said the young Crab, a little\\rsnappishly. Youre enough to try the patience of an oyster!\\r\\rI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do! said Alice aloud,\\raddressing nobody in particular. Shed soon fetch it back!\\r\\rAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question said the\\rLory.\\r\\rAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet\\rDinahs our cat. And shes such a capital one for catching mice you\\rcant think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\\rshell eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\\r\\rThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\\rbirds hurried off at once one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\\rcarefully, remarking, I really must be getting home the nightair\\rdoesnt suit my throat! and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\\rto its children, Come away, my dears! Its high time you were all in\\rbed! On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\\ralone.\\r\\rI wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah! she said to herself in a melancholy\\rtone. Nobody seems to like her, down here, and Im sure shes the best\\rcat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\\rany more! And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\\rlonely and lowspirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\\rlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\\reagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\\rcoming back to finish his story.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER IV.\\rThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\\r\\r\\rIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\\ranxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something and she heard\\rit muttering to itself The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\\rmy fur and whiskers! Shell get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\\rferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder Alice guessed in a\\rmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\\rgloves, and she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them, but\\rthey were nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since\\rher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\\rlittle door, had vanished completely.\\r\\rVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\\rcalled out to her in an angry tone, Why, Mary Ann, what are you\\rdoing out here Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\\ra fan! Quick, now! And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\\rat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\\rmistake it had made.\\r\\rHe took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran. How\\rsurprised hell be when he finds out who I am! But Id better take him\\rhis fan and glovesthat is, if I can find them. As she said this, she\\rcame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\rplate with the name W. RABBIT, engraved upon it. She went in without\\rknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\rreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\rfan and gloves.\\r\\rHow queer it seems, Alice said to herself, to be going messages for\\ra rabbit! I suppose Dinahll be sending me on messages next! And she\\rbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen Miss Alice! Come\\rhere directly, and get ready for your walk! Coming in a minute,\\rnurse! But Ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out. Only I\\rdont think, Alice went on, that theyd let Dinah stop in the house\\rif it began ordering people about like that!\\r\\rBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\rin the window, and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three\\rpairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the\\rgloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\\rlittle bottle that stood near the lookingglass. There was no label\\rthis time with the words DRINK ME, but nevertheless she uncorked it\\rand put it to her lips. I know something interesting is sure to\\rhappen, she said to herself, whenever I eat or drink anything so\\rIll just see what this bottle does. I do hope itll make me grow large\\ragain, for really Im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\\r\\rIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected before she had\\rdrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\rand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\\rdown the bottle, saying to herself Thats quite enoughI hope I shant\\rgrow any moreAs it is, I cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt\\rdrunk quite so much!\\r\\rAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\\rand very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there\\rwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\rone elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\rStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\rof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself Now I\\rcan do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me\\r\\rLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\rand she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\rseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\ragain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\r\\rIt was much pleasanter at home, thought poor Alice, when one wasnt\\ralways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\\rrabbits. I almost wish I hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand\\ryetits rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\\rcan have happened to me! When I used to read fairytales, I fancied\\rthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\\rone! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\\rwhen I grow up, Ill write onebut Im grown up now, she added in a\\rsorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here.\\r\\rBut then, thought Alice, shall I never get any older than I am\\rnow Thatll be a comfort, one waynever to be an old womanbut\\rthenalways to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldnt like that!\\r\\rOh, you foolish Alice! she answered herself. How can you learn\\rlessons in here Why, theres hardly room for you, and no room at all\\rfor any lessonbooks!\\r\\rAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\\rmaking quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes\\rshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\r\\rMary Ann! Mary Ann! said the voice. Fetch me my gloves this moment!\\rThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\\rthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\\rhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\\rlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\r\\rPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it but, as\\rthe door opened inwards, and Alices elbow was pressed hard against it,\\rthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself Then Ill\\rgo round and get in at the window.\\r\\rThat you wont! thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\\rshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\rhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\rbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\rfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\rcucumberframe, or something of the sort.\\r\\rNext came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat! Pat! Where are you And\\rthen a voice she had never heard before, Sure then Im here! Digging\\rfor apples, yer honour!\\r\\rDigging for apples, indeed! said the Rabbit angrily. Here! Come and\\rhelp me out of this! Sounds of more broken glass.\\r\\rNow tell me, Pat, whats that in the window\\r\\rSure, its an arm, yer honour! He pronounced it arrum.\\r\\rAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size Why, it fills the whole\\rwindow!\\r\\rSure, it does, yer honour but its an arm for all that.\\r\\rWell, its got no business there, at any rate go and take it away!\\r\\rThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\\rnow and then such as, Sure, I dont like it, yer honour, at all, at\\rall! Do as I tell you, you coward! and at last she spread out her\\rhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\\rtwo little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. What a number\\rof cucumberframes there must be! thought Alice. I wonder what\\rtheyll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\\rcould! Im sure I dont want to stay in here any longer!\\r\\rShe waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a\\rrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\\rtalking together she made out the words Wheres the other\\rladderWhy, I hadnt to bring but one Bills got the otherBill!\\rfetch it here, lad!Here, put em up at this cornerNo, tie em\\rtogether firstthey dont reach half high enough yetOh! theyll do\\rwell enough dont be particularHere, Bill! catch hold of this\\rropeWill the roof bearMind that loose slateOh, its coming down!\\rHeads below! a loud crashNow, who did thatIt was Bill, I\\rfancyWhos to go down the chimneyNay, I shant! You do\\rit!That I wont, then!Bills to go downHere, Bill! the master says\\ryoure to go down the chimney!\\r\\rOh! So Bills got to come down the chimney, has he said Alice to\\rherself. Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldnt be in\\rBills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow, to be sure but\\rI think I can kick a little!\\r\\rShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\\rshe heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was\\rscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then,\\rsaying to herself This is Bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited\\rto see what would happen next.\\r\\rThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes Bill!\\rthen the Rabbits voice alongCatch him, you by the hedge! then\\rsilence, and then another confusion of voicesHold up his headBrandy\\rnowDont choke himHow was it, old fellow What happened to you Tell\\rus all about it!\\r\\rLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, Thats Bill, thought\\rAlice, Well, I hardly knowNo more, thank ye Im better nowbut Im\\ra deal too flustered to tell youall I know is, something comes at me\\rlike a Jackinthebox, and up I goes like a skyrocket!\\r\\rSo you did, old fellow! said the others.\\r\\rWe must burn the house down! said the Rabbits voice and Alice\\rcalled out as loud as she could, If you do, Ill set Dinah at you!\\r\\rThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, I\\rwonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, theyd take the\\rroof off. After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\\rAlice heard the Rabbit say, A barrowful will do, to begin with.\\r\\rA barrowful of what thought Alice but she had not long to doubt,\\rfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\rwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. Ill put a stop to\\rthis, she said to herself, and shouted out, Youd better not do that\\ragain! which produced another dead silence.\\r\\rAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\\rlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\\rhead. If I eat one of these cakes, she thought, its sure to make\\rsome change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger, it\\rmust make me smaller, I suppose.\\r\\rSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\\rbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\\rthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\\rlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\\rwas in the middle, being held up by two guineapigs, who were giving it\\rsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\\rappeared but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\\rsafe in a thick wood.\\r\\rThe first thing Ive got to do, said Alice to herself, as she\\rwandered about in the wood, is to grow to my right size again and the\\rsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\\rwill be the best plan.\\r\\rIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\\rarranged the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\\rhow to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among\\rthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\rgreat hurry.\\r\\rAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\\rfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. Poor little\\rthing! said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\\rit but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\\rmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\\rspite of all her coaxing.\\r\\rHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\\rheld it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\rall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\\rand made believe to worry it then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\\rto keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the\\rother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\rover heels in its hurry to get hold of it then Alice, thinking it was\\rvery like having a game of play with a carthorse, and expecting every\\rmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again then\\rthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\rlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\rall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\rits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\\r\\rThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she\\rset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\\rand till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\\r\\rAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was! said Alice, as she leant\\ragainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\\rleaves I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, ifif Id\\ronly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! Id nearly forgotten that\\rIve got to grow up again! Let me seehow is it to be managed I\\rsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other but the great\\rquestion is, what\\r\\rThe great question certainly was, what Alice looked all round her at\\rthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\\rlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\\rThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\\rherself and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\\rbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\\rwas on the top of it.\\r\\rShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\\rmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\\rthat was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a\\rlong hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything\\relse.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER V.\\rAdvice from a Caterpillar\\r\\r\\rThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\\rsilence at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\\raddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\\r\\rWho are you said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\\rrather shyly, II hardly know, sir, just at presentat least I know\\rwho I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\rchanged several times since then.\\r\\rWhat do you mean by that said the Caterpillar sternly. Explain\\ryourself!\\r\\rI cant explain myself, Im afraid, sir, said Alice, because Im\\rnot myself, you see.\\r\\rI dont see, said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rIm afraid I cant put it more clearly, Alice replied very politely,\\rfor I cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many\\rdifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.\\r\\rIt isnt, said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rWell, perhaps you havent found it so yet, said Alice but when you\\rhave to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day, you knowand then\\rafter that into a butterfly, I should think youll feel it a little\\rqueer, wont you\\r\\rNot a bit, said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rWell, perhaps your feelings may be different, said Alice all I know\\ris, it would feel very queer to me.\\r\\rYou! said the Caterpillar contemptuously. Who are you\\r\\rWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\rAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars making such very\\rshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, I\\rthink, you ought to tell me who you are, first.\\r\\rWhy said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rHere was another puzzling question and as Alice could not think of any\\rgood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant\\rstate of mind, she turned away.\\r\\rCome back! the Caterpillar called after her. Ive something\\rimportant to say!\\r\\rThis sounded promising, certainly Alice turned and came back again.\\r\\rKeep your temper, said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rIs that all said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\rcould.\\r\\rNo, said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\\rand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\\rsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\\rits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, So you\\rthink youre changed, do you\\r\\rIm afraid I am, sir, said Alice I cant remember things as I\\rusedand I dont keep the same size for ten minutes together!\\r\\rCant remember what things said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rWell, Ive tried to say How doth the little busy bee, but it all\\rcame different! Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\r\\rRepeat, You are old, Father William, said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rAlice folded her hands, and began\\r\\rYou are old, Father William, the young man said,\\r And your hair has become very white\\rAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\\r Do you think, at your age, it is right\\r\\rIn my youth, Father William replied to his son,\\r I feared it might injure the brain\\rBut, now that Im perfectly sure I have none,\\r Why, I do it again and again.\\r\\rYou are old, said the youth, as I mentioned before,\\r And have grown most uncommonly fat\\rYet you turned a backsomersault in at the door\\r Pray, what is the reason of that\\r\\rIn my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\\r I kept all my limbs very supple\\rBy the use of this ointmentone shilling the box\\r Allow me to sell you a couple\\r\\rYou are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak\\r For anything tougher than suet\\rYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\\r Pray, how did you manage to do it\\r\\rIn my youth, said his father, I took to the law,\\r And argued each case with my wife\\rAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\\r Has lasted the rest of my life.\\r\\rYou are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose\\r That your eye was as steady as ever\\rYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\\r What made you so awfully clever\\r\\rI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\\r Said his father dont give yourself airs!\\rDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff\\r Be off, or Ill kick you down stairs!\\r\\r\\rThat is not said right, said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rNot quite right, Im afraid, said Alice, timidly some of the\\rwords have got altered.\\r\\rIt is wrong from beginning to end, said the Caterpillar decidedly,\\rand there was silence for some minutes.\\r\\rThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\r\\rWhat size do you want to be it asked.\\r\\rOh, Im not particular as to size, Alice hastily replied only one\\rdoesnt like changing so often, you know.\\r\\rI dont know, said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rAlice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\rbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\r\\rAre you content now said the Caterpillar.\\r\\rWell, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldnt\\rmind, said Alice three inches is such a wretched height to be.\\r\\rIt is a very good height indeed! said the Caterpillar angrily,\\rrearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high.\\r\\rBut Im not used to it! pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\\rthought of herself, I wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily\\roffended!\\r\\rYoull get used to it in time, said the Caterpillar and it put the\\rhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\r\\rThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\\rminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\\ryawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\\rmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\\rOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\\rgrow shorter.\\r\\rOne side of what The other side of what thought Alice to\\rherself.\\r\\rOf the mushroom, said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\raloud and in another moment it was out of sight.\\r\\rAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\\rtrying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was\\rperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\\rlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\\roff a bit of the edge with each hand.\\r\\rAnd now which is which she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\rthe righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a\\rviolent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot!\\r\\rShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\\rthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly so she\\rset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\\rso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\\rmouth but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\rlefthand bit.\\r\\r      \\r\\r      \\r\\r      \\r\\r\\rCome, my heads free at last! said Alice in a tone of delight, which\\rchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\\rwere nowhere to be found all she could see, when she looked down, was\\ran immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\rsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\r\\rWhat can all that green stuff be said Alice. And where have my\\rshoulders got to And oh, my poor hands, how is it I cant see you\\rShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\rexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\r\\rAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\\rshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\\rher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\\rhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\\rgoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\\rthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\\rhiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her\\rface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\\r\\rSerpent! screamed the Pigeon.\\r\\rIm not a serpent! said Alice indignantly. Let me alone!\\r\\rSerpent, I say again! repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\\rtone, and added with a kind of sob, Ive tried every way, and nothing\\rseems to suit them!\\r\\rI havent the least idea what youre talking about, said Alice.\\r\\rIve tried the roots of trees, and Ive tried banks, and Ive tried\\rhedges, the Pigeon went on, without attending to her but those\\rserpents! Theres no pleasing them!\\r\\rAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\\rsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\r\\rAs if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the Pigeon\\rbut I must be on the lookout for serpents night and day! Why, I\\rhavent had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\\r\\rIm very sorry youve been annoyed, said Alice, who was beginning to\\rsee its meaning.\\r\\rAnd just as Id taken the highest tree in the wood, continued the\\rPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, and just as I was thinking I\\rshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\\rfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\\r\\rBut Im not a serpent, I tell you! said Alice. Im aIm a\\r\\rWell! What are you said the Pigeon. I can see youre trying to\\rinvent something!\\r\\rIIm a little girl, said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\\rthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\\r\\rA likely story indeed! said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\rcontempt. Ive seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\\rone with such a neck as that! No, no! Youre a serpent and theres\\rno use denying it. I suppose youll be telling me next that you never\\rtasted an egg!\\r\\rI have tasted eggs, certainly, said Alice, who was a very truthful\\rchild but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\rknow.\\r\\rI dont believe it, said the Pigeon but if they do, why then\\rtheyre a kind of serpent, thats all I can say.\\r\\rThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\rminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, Youre\\rlooking for eggs, I know that well enough and what does it matter to\\rme whether youre a little girl or a serpent\\r\\rIt matters a good deal to me, said Alice hastily but Im not\\rlooking for eggs, as it happens and if I was, I shouldnt want\\ryours I dont like them raw.\\r\\rWell, be off, then! said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\rdown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\\ras she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\\rand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\\rshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\\rand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\\rthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\\rshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\r\\rIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\\rfelt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes,\\rand began talking to herself, as usual. Come, theres half my plan\\rdone now! How puzzling all these changes are! Im never sure what Im\\rgoing to be, from one minute to another! However, Ive got back to my\\rright size the next thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenhow\\ris that to be done, I wonder As she said this, she came suddenly\\rupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\\rWhoever lives there, thought Alice, itll never do to come upon them\\rthis size why, I should frighten them out of their wits! So she\\rbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\\rnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER VI.\\rPig and Pepper\\r\\r\\rFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\\rto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\\rwoodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery\\rotherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\\rfishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\\ranother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\\rfrog and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\\rall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\\rabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\r\\rThe FishFootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\rnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\\rsaying, in a solemn tone, For the Duchess. An invitation from the\\rQueen to play croquet. The FrogFootman repeated, in the same solemn\\rtone, only changing the order of the words a little, From the Queen.\\rAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\\r\\rThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\r\\rAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\\rfor fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the\\rFishFootman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\rdoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\r\\rAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\r\\rTheres no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and that for\\rtwo reasons. First, because Im on the same side of the door as you\\rare secondly, because theyre making such a noise inside, no one could\\rpossibly hear you. And certainly there was a most extraordinary\\rnoise going on withina constant howling and sneezing, and every now\\rand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\\rpieces.\\r\\rPlease, then, said Alice, how am I to get in\\r\\rThere might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went on\\rwithout attending to her, if we had the door between us. For instance,\\rif you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\\rknow. He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\\rthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. But perhaps he cant help it,\\rshe said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his\\rhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.How am I to get in\\rshe repeated, aloud.\\r\\rI shall sit here, the Footman remarked, till tomorrow\\r\\rAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\\rskimming out, straight at the Footmans head it just grazed his nose,\\rand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\r\\ror next day, maybe, the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\\ras if nothing had happened.\\r\\rHow am I to get in asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\r\\rAre you to get in at all said the Footman. Thats the first\\rquestion, you know.\\r\\rIt was, no doubt only Alice did not like to be told so. Its really\\rdreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the creatures argue.\\rIts enough to drive one crazy!\\r\\rThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\rremark, with variations. I shall sit here, he said, on and off, for\\rdays and days.\\r\\rBut what am I to do said Alice.\\r\\rAnything you like, said the Footman, and began whistling.\\r\\rOh, theres no use in talking to him, said Alice desperately hes\\rperfectly idiotic! And she opened the door and went in.\\r\\rThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\\rone end to the other the Duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool\\rin the middle, nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire,\\rstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\\r\\rTheres certainly too much pepper in that soup! Alice said to\\rherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\\r\\rThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\\roccasionally and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\ralternately without a moments pause. The only things in the kitchen\\rthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\\ron the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\r\\rPlease would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\rnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, why\\ryour cat grins like that\\r\\rIts a Cheshire cat, said the Duchess, and thats why. Pig!\\r\\rShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\rjumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\\rbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again\\r\\rI didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact, I didnt\\rknow that cats could grin.\\r\\rThey all can, said the Duchess and most of em do.\\r\\rI dont know of any that do, Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\rpleased to have got into a conversation.\\r\\rYou dont know much, said the Duchess and thats a fact.\\r\\rAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\rbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\\rwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\rfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\rthe Duchess and the babythe fireirons came first then followed a\\rshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\\rthem even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already,\\rthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\r\\rOh, please mind what youre doing! cried Alice, jumping up and down\\rin an agony of terror. Oh, there goes his precious nose! as an\\runusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\\roff.\\r\\rIf everybody minded their own business, the Duchess said in a hoarse\\rgrowl, the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\\r\\rWhich would not be an advantage, said Alice, who felt very glad to\\rget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. Just\\rthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\\rearth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axis\\r\\rTalking of axes, said the Duchess, chop off her head!\\r\\rAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\rthe hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\rbe listening, so she went on again Twentyfour hours, I think or\\ris it twelve I\\r\\rOh, dont bother me, said the Duchess I never could abide\\rfigures! And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\\rsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\\rthe end of every line\\r\\rSpeak roughly to your little boy,\\r And beat him when he sneezes\\rHe only does it to annoy,\\r Because he knows it teases.\\r\\r\\rCHORUS.\\rIn which the cook and the baby joined\\r\\r\\rWow! wow! wow!\\r\\r\\rWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\rthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\rthat Alice could hardly hear the words\\r\\rI speak severely to my boy,\\r I beat him when he sneezes\\rFor he can thoroughly enjoy\\r The pepper when he pleases!\\r\\r\\rCHORUS.\\r\\r\\rWow! wow! wow!\\r\\r\\rHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like! the Duchess said to Alice,\\rflinging the baby at her as she spoke. I must go and get ready to play\\rcroquet with the Queen, and she hurried out of the room. The cook\\rthrew a fryingpan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\\r\\rAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queershaped\\rlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\\rjust like a starfish, thought Alice. The poor little thing was\\rsnorting like a steamengine when she caught it, and kept doubling\\ritself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\\rthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\\r\\rAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, which was to\\rtwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\\rear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself, she carried it\\rout into the open air. If I dont take this child away with me,\\rthought Alice, theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be\\rmurder to leave it behind She said the last words out loud, and the\\rlittle thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time.\\rDont grunt, said Alice thats not at all a proper way of\\rexpressing yourself.\\r\\rThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\\rto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\\ra very turnup nose, much more like a snout than a real nose also\\rits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether Alice did\\rnot like the look of the thing at all. But perhaps it was only\\rsobbing, she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\\rwere any tears.\\r\\rNo, there were no tears. If youre going to turn into a pig, my dear,\\rsaid Alice, seriously, Ill have nothing more to do with you. Mind\\rnow! The poor little thing sobbed again or grunted, it was impossible\\rto say which, and they went on for some while in silence.\\r\\rAlice was just beginning to think to herself, Now, what am I to do\\rwith this creature when I get it home when it grunted again, so\\rviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\\rthere could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than\\ra pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\\rfurther.\\r\\rSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\\rtrot away quietly into the wood. If it had grown up, she said to\\rherself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes\\rrather a handsome pig, I think. And she began thinking over other\\rchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\\rto herself, if one only knew the right way to change them when she\\rwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\\ra tree a few yards off.\\r\\rThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked goodnatured, she\\rthought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she\\rfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\\r\\rCheshire Puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\\rwhether it would like the name however, it only grinned a little\\rwider. Come, its pleased so far, thought Alice, and she went on.\\rWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here\\r\\rThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the Cat.\\r\\rI dont much care where said Alice.\\r\\rThen it doesnt matter which way you go, said the Cat.\\r\\rso long as I get somewhere, Alice added as an explanation.\\r\\rOh, youre sure to do that, said the Cat, if you only walk long\\renough.\\r\\rAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\\rquestion. What sort of people live about here\\r\\rIn that direction, the Cat said, waving its right paw round, lives\\ra Hatter and in that direction, waving the other paw, lives a\\rMarch Hare. Visit either you like theyre both mad.\\r\\rBut I dont want to go among mad people, Alice remarked.\\r\\rOh, you cant help that, said the Cat were all mad here. Im mad.\\rYoure mad.\\r\\rHow do you know Im mad said Alice.\\r\\rYou must be, said the Cat, or you wouldnt have come here.\\r\\rAlice didnt think that proved it at all however, she went on And how\\rdo you know that youre mad\\r\\rTo begin with, said the Cat, a dogs not mad. You grant that\\r\\rI suppose so, said Alice.\\r\\rWell, then, the Cat went on, you see, a dog growls when its angry,\\rand wags its tail when its pleased. Now I growl when Im pleased,\\rand wag my tail when Im angry. Therefore Im mad.\\r\\rI call it purring, not growling, said Alice.\\r\\rCall it what you like, said the Cat. Do you play croquet with the\\rQueen today\\r\\rI should like it very much, said Alice, but I havent been invited\\ryet.\\r\\rYoull see me there, said the Cat, and vanished.\\r\\rAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\\rthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\\rit suddenly appeared again.\\r\\rBythebye, what became of the baby said the Cat. Id nearly\\rforgotten to ask.\\r\\rIt turned into a pig, Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\\rin a natural way.\\r\\rI thought it would, said the Cat, and vanished again.\\r\\rAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\\rappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\rwhich the March Hare was said to live. Ive seen hatters before, she\\rsaid to herself the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\\rperhaps as this is May it wont be raving madat least not so mad as it\\rwas in March. As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\\ragain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\\r\\rDid you say pig, or fig said the Cat.\\r\\rI said pig, replied Alice and I wish you wouldnt keep appearing\\rand vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy.\\r\\rAll right, said the Cat and this time it vanished quite slowly,\\rbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\\rremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\\r\\rWell! Ive often seen a cat without a grin, thought Alice but a\\rgrin without a cat! Its the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\\r\\rShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\\rthe March Hare she thought it must be the right house, because the\\rchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\\rwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\rnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\\rto about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather\\rtimidly, saying to herself Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\\rI almost wish Id gone to see the Hatter instead!\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER VII.\\rA Mad TeaParty\\r\\r\\rThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\rMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it a Dormouse was sitting\\rbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\rcushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. Very\\runcomfortable for the Dormouse, thought Alice only, as its asleep,\\rI suppose it doesnt mind.\\r\\rThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\rone corner of it No room! No room! they cried out when they saw\\rAlice coming. Theres plenty of room! said Alice indignantly, and\\rshe sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table.\\r\\rHave some wine, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\r\\rAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\rI dont see any wine, she remarked.\\r\\rThere isnt any, said the March Hare.\\r\\rThen it wasnt very civil of you to offer it, said Alice angrily.\\r\\rIt wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said\\rthe March Hare.\\r\\rI didnt know it was your table, said Alice its laid for a great\\rmany more than three.\\r\\rYour hair wants cutting, said the Hatter. He had been looking at\\rAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\\rspeech.\\r\\rYou should learn not to make personal remarks, Alice said with some\\rseverity its very rude.\\r\\rThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said\\rwas, Why is a raven like a writingdesk\\r\\rCome, we shall have some fun now! thought Alice. Im glad theyve\\rbegun asking riddles.I believe I can guess that, she added aloud.\\r\\rDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said\\rthe March Hare.\\r\\rExactly so, said Alice.\\r\\rThen you should say what you mean, the March Hare went on.\\r\\rI do, Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what I\\rsaythats the same thing, you know.\\r\\rNot the same thing a bit! said the Hatter. You might just as well\\rsay that I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat what I see!\\r\\rYou might just as well say, added the March Hare, that I like what\\rI get is the same thing as I get what I like!\\r\\rYou might just as well say, added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\rtalking in his sleep, that I breathe when I sleep is the same thing\\ras I sleep when I breathe!\\r\\rIt is the same thing with you, said the Hatter, and here the\\rconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\\rAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\\rwritingdesks, which wasnt much.\\r\\rThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. What day of the month\\ris it he said, turning to Alice he had taken his watch out of his\\rpocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\rand holding it to his ear.\\r\\rAlice considered a little, and then said The fourth.\\r\\rTwo days wrong! sighed the Hatter. I told you butter wouldnt suit\\rthe works! he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\r\\rIt was the best butter, the March Hare meekly replied.\\r\\rYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, the Hatter grumbled\\ryou shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife.\\r\\rThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped\\rit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again but he could think of\\rnothing better to say than his first remark, It was the best butter,\\ryou know.\\r\\rAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. What a\\rfunny watch! she remarked. It tells the day of the month, and doesnt\\rtell what oclock it is!\\r\\rWhy should it muttered the Hatter. Does your watch tell you what\\ryear it is\\r\\rOf course not, Alice replied very readily but thats because it\\rstays the same year for such a long time together.\\r\\rWhich is just the case with mine, said the Hatter.\\r\\rAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatters remark seemed to have no\\rsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. I dont quite\\runderstand you, she said, as politely as she could.\\r\\rThe Dormouse is asleep again, said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\rhot tea upon its nose.\\r\\rThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\reyes, Of course, of course just what I was going to remark myself.\\r\\rHave you guessed the riddle yet the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\ragain.\\r\\rNo, I give it up, Alice replied whats the answer\\r\\rI havent the slightest idea, said the Hatter.\\r\\rNor I, said the March Hare.\\r\\rAlice sighed wearily. I think you might do something better with the\\rtime, she said, than waste it in asking riddles that have no\\ranswers.\\r\\rIf you knew Time as well as I do, said the Hatter, you wouldnt talk\\rabout wasting it. Its him.\\r\\rI dont know what you mean, said Alice.\\r\\rOf course you dont! the Hatter said, tossing his head\\rcontemptuously. I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\\r\\rPerhaps not, Alice cautiously replied but I know I have to beat\\rtime when I learn music.\\r\\rAh! that accounts for it, said the Hatter. He wont stand beating.\\rNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, hed do almost anything\\ryou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine oclock in\\rthe morning, just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a\\rhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Halfpast one,\\rtime for dinner!\\r\\rI only wish it was, the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.\\r\\rThat would be grand, certainly, said Alice thoughtfully but thenI\\rshouldnt be hungry for it, you know.\\r\\rNot at first, perhaps, said the Hatter but you could keep it to\\rhalfpast one as long as you liked.\\r\\rIs that the way you manage Alice asked.\\r\\rThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. Not I! he replied. We\\rquarrelled last Marchjust before he went mad, you know pointing\\rwith his tea spoon at the March Hare, it was at the great concert\\rgiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\r\\rTwinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\rHow I wonder what youre at!\\r\\r\\rYou know the song, perhaps\\r\\rIve heard something like it, said Alice.\\r\\rIt goes on, you know, the Hatter continued, in this way\\r\\rUp above the world you fly,\\rLike a teatray in the sky.\\r Twinkle, twinkle\\r\\r\\rHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\\rTwinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle and went on so long that they\\rhad to pinch it to make it stop.\\r\\rWell, Id hardly finished the first verse, said the Hatter, when the\\rQueen jumped up and bawled out, Hes murdering the time! Off with his\\rhead!\\r\\rHow dreadfully savage! exclaimed Alice.\\r\\rAnd ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, he wont\\rdo a thing I ask! Its always six oclock now.\\r\\rA bright idea came into Alices head. Is that the reason so many\\rteathings are put out here she asked.\\r\\rYes, thats it, said the Hatter with a sigh its always teatime,\\rand weve no time to wash the things between whiles.\\r\\rThen you keep moving round, I suppose said Alice.\\r\\rExactly so, said the Hatter as the things get used up.\\r\\rBut what happens when you come to the beginning again Alice ventured\\rto ask.\\r\\rSuppose we change the subject, the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\rIm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\\r\\rIm afraid I dont know one, said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\rproposal.\\r\\rThen the Dormouse shall! they both cried. Wake up, Dormouse! And\\rthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\r\\rThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. I wasnt asleep, he said in a\\rhoarse, feeble voice I heard every word you fellows were saying.\\r\\rTell us a story! said the March Hare.\\r\\rYes, please do! pleaded Alice.\\r\\rAnd be quick about it, added the Hatter, or youll be asleep again\\rbefore its done.\\r\\rOnce upon a time there were three little sisters, the Dormouse began\\rin a great hurry and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie and\\rthey lived at the bottom of a well\\r\\rWhat did they live on said Alice, who always took a great interest\\rin questions of eating and drinking.\\r\\rThey lived on treacle, said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\rtwo.\\r\\rThey couldnt have done that, you know, Alice gently remarked\\rtheyd have been ill.\\r\\rSo they were, said the Dormouse very ill.\\r\\rAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\rliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on But\\rwhy did they live at the bottom of a well\\r\\rTake some more tea, the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\r\\rIve had nothing yet, Alice replied in an offended tone, so I cant\\rtake more.\\r\\rYou mean you cant take less, said the Hatter its very easy to\\rtake more than nothing.\\r\\rNobody asked your opinion, said Alice.\\r\\rWhos making personal remarks now the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\r\\rAlice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to\\rsome tea and breadandbutter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\rrepeated her question. Why did they live at the bottom of a well\\r\\rThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\rsaid, It was a treaclewell.\\r\\rTheres no such thing! Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\rHatter and the March Hare went Sh! sh! and the Dormouse sulkily\\rremarked, If you cant be civil, youd better finish the story for\\ryourself.\\r\\rNo, please go on! Alice said very humbly I wont interrupt again. I\\rdare say there may be one.\\r\\rOne, indeed! said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\rgo on. And so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw,\\ryou know\\r\\rWhat did they draw said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\r\\rTreacle, said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\r\\rI want a clean cup, interrupted the Hatter lets all move one place\\ron.\\r\\rHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him the March Hare\\rmoved into the Dormouses place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\\rplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\radvantage from the change and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\rbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milkjug into his plate.\\r\\rAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\rcautiously But I dont understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\rfrom\\r\\rYou can draw water out of a waterwell, said the Hatter so I should\\rthink you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh, stupid\\r\\rBut they were in the well, Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\\rto notice this last remark.\\r\\rOf course they were, said the Dormouse well in.\\r\\rThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\rsome time without interrupting it.\\r\\rThey were learning to draw, the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\rits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of\\rthingseverything that begins with an M\\r\\rWhy with an M said Alice.\\r\\rWhy not said the March Hare.\\r\\rAlice was silent.\\r\\rThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\\rdoze but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\\rlittle shriek, and went on that begins with an M, such as\\rmousetraps, and the moon, and memory, and muchnessyou know you say\\rthings are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a\\rdrawing of a muchness\\r\\rReally, now you ask me, said Alice, very much confused, I dont\\rthink\\r\\rThen you shouldnt talk, said the Hatter.\\r\\rThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear she got up in\\rgreat disgust, and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\rneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\rlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her\\rthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\rthe teapot.\\r\\rAt any rate Ill never go there again! said Alice as she picked her\\rway through the wood. Its the stupidest teaparty I ever was at in\\rall my life!\\r\\rJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\rleading right into it. Thats very curious! she thought. But\\reverythings curious today. I think I may as well go in at once. And\\rin she went.\\r\\rOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\\rglass table. Now, Ill manage better this time, she said to herself,\\rand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\\rled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\\rshe had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot\\rhigh then she walked down the little passage and thenshe found\\rherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds\\rand the cool fountains.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER VIII.\\rThe Queens CroquetGround\\r\\r\\rA large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses\\rgrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\rpainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\\rwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\\rone of them say, Look out now, Five! Dont go splashing paint over me\\rlike that!\\r\\rI couldnt help it, said Five, in a sulky tone Seven jogged my\\relbow.\\r\\rOn which Seven looked up and said, Thats right, Five! Always lay the\\rblame on others!\\r\\rYoud better not talk! said Five. I heard the Queen say only\\ryesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\\r\\rWhat for said the one who had spoken first.\\r\\rThats none of your business, Two! said Seven.\\r\\rYes, it is his business! said Five, and Ill tell himit was for\\rbringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions.\\r\\rSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun Well, of all the unjust\\rthings when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\\rthem, and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also,\\rand all of them bowed low.\\r\\rWould you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, why you are\\rpainting those roses\\r\\rFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\\rvoice, Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\rred rosetree, and we put a white one in by mistake and if the Queen\\rwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\\ryou see, Miss, were doing our best, afore she comes, to At this\\rmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\rout The Queen! The Queen! and the three gardeners instantly threw\\rthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\\rand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\r\\rFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the\\rthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\\rcorners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with\\rdiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\\rthe royal children there were ten of them, and the little dears came\\rjumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples they were all\\rornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\\rand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit it was talking in a\\rhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\\rby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\\rthe Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and, last of all this\\rgrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\r\\rAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\rlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\rof such a rule at processions and besides, what would be the use of a\\rprocession, thought she, if people had all to lie down upon their\\rfaces, so that they couldnt see it So she stood still where she was,\\rand waited.\\r\\rWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\rat her, and the Queen said severely Who is this She said it to the\\rKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\r\\rIdiot! said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently and, turning to\\rAlice, she went on, Whats your name, child\\r\\rMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty, said Alice very politely\\rbut she added, to herself, Why, theyre only a pack of cards, after\\rall. I neednt be afraid of them!\\r\\rAnd who are these said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\\rwho were lying round the rosetree for, you see, as they were lying on\\rtheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\\rthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\\ror courtiers, or three of her own children.\\r\\rHow should I know said Alice, surprised at her own courage. Its\\rno business of mine.\\r\\rThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\rmoment like a wild beast, screamed Off with her head! Off\\r\\rNonsense! said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\rsilent.\\r\\rThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said Consider, my\\rdear she is only a child!\\r\\rThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave Turn\\rthem over!\\r\\rThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\r\\rGet up! said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\\rgardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\\rthe royal children, and everybody else.\\r\\rLeave off that! screamed the Queen. You make me giddy. And then,\\rturning to the rosetree, she went on, What have you been doing\\rhere\\r\\rMay it please your Majesty, said Two, in a very humble tone, going\\rdown on one knee as he spoke, we were trying\\r\\rI see! said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\rOff with their heads! and the procession moved on, three of the\\rsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\\rto Alice for protection.\\r\\rYou shant be beheaded! said Alice, and she put them into a large\\rflowerpot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\\rminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\\rothers.\\r\\rAre their heads off shouted the Queen.\\r\\rTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty! the soldiers shouted\\rin reply.\\r\\rThats right! shouted the Queen. Can you play croquet\\r\\rThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\\revidently meant for her.\\r\\rYes! shouted Alice.\\r\\rCome on, then! roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\\rwondering very much what would happen next.\\r\\rItsits a very fine day! said a timid voice at her side. She was\\rwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\r\\rVery, said Alice wheres the Duchess\\r\\rHush! Hush! said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\\ranxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\\rtiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered Shes under\\rsentence of execution.\\r\\rWhat for said Alice.\\r\\rDid you say What a pity! the Rabbit asked.\\r\\rNo, I didnt, said Alice I dont think its at all a pity. I said\\rWhat for\\r\\rShe boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\\rscream of laughter. Oh, hush! the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\rtone. The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\\rQueen said\\r\\rGet to your places! shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\rpeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\rother however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\rbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground\\rin her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live\\rhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\\rthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\r\\rThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo\\rshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\\runder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\\rhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\\rhedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look\\rup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\\rbursting out laughing and when she had got its head down, and was\\rgoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\\rhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away besides all\\rthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\\rwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubledup soldiers were\\ralways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\\rsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\r\\rThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\rall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time\\rthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\rshouting Off with his head! or Off with her head! about once in a\\rminute.\\r\\rAlice began to feel very uneasy to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\rdispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\rand then, thought she, what would become of me Theyre dreadfully\\rfond of beheading people here the great wonder is, that theres any\\rone left alive!\\r\\rShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\rcould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\\rappearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\\rwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\\rto herself Its the Cheshire Cat now I shall have somebody to talk\\rto.\\r\\rHow are you getting on said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\renough for it to speak with.\\r\\rAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. Its no use\\rspeaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at least one\\rof them. In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\rdown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\rshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\\rwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\r\\rI dont think they play at all fairly, Alice began, in rather a\\rcomplaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear\\roneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at\\rleast, if there are, nobody attends to themand youve no idea how\\rconfusing it is all the things being alive for instance, theres the\\rarch Ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\rgroundand I should have croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now, only\\rit ran away when it saw mine coming!\\r\\rHow do you like the Queen said the Cat in a low voice.\\r\\rNot at all, said Alice shes so extremely Just then she noticed\\rthat the Queen was close behind her, listening so she went on,\\rlikely to win, that its hardly worth while finishing the game.\\r\\rThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\r\\rWho are you talking to said the King, going up to Alice, and\\rlooking at the Cats head with great curiosity.\\r\\rIts a friend of minea Cheshire Cat, said Alice allow me to\\rintroduce it.\\r\\rI dont like the look of it at all, said the King however, it may\\rkiss my hand if it likes.\\r\\rId rather not, the Cat remarked.\\r\\rDont be impertinent, said the King, and dont look at me like\\rthat! He got behind Alice as he spoke.\\r\\rA cat may look at a king, said Alice. Ive read that in some book,\\rbut I dont remember where.\\r\\rWell, it must be removed, said the King very decidedly, and he called\\rthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, My dear! I wish you would\\rhave this cat removed!\\r\\rThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\\rsmall. Off with his head! she said, without even looking round.\\r\\rIll fetch the executioner myself, said the King eagerly, and he\\rhurried off.\\r\\rAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\ron, as she heard the Queens voice in the distance, screaming with\\rpassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\rexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\rof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\rwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\\r\\rThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\rto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\rother the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\\rthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\\rhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\\r\\rBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\rwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt\\rmatter much, thought Alice, as all the arches are gone from this side\\rof the ground. So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\rescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\rfriend.\\r\\rWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\\ra large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between\\rthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\rwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\r\\rThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\rthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\rall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\rwhat they said.\\r\\rThe executioners argument was, that you couldnt cut off a head unless\\rthere was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a\\rthing before, and he wasnt going to begin at his time of life.\\r\\rThe Kings argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\rbeheaded, and that you werent to talk nonsense.\\r\\rThe Queens argument was, that if something wasnt done about it in\\rless than no time shed have everybody executed, all round. It was\\rthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\\ranxious.\\r\\rAlice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the\\rDuchess youd better ask her about it.\\r\\rShes in prison, the Queen said to the executioner fetch her here.\\rAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\\r\\rThe Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\\rtime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared so\\rthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\\rwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER IX.\\rThe Mock Turtles Story\\r\\r\\rYou cant think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\\rsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alices,\\rand they walked off together.\\r\\rAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\\rto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\rsavage when they met in the kitchen.\\r\\rWhen Im a Duchess, she said to herself, not in a very hopeful\\rtone though, I wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup\\rdoes very well withoutMaybe its always pepper that makes people\\rhottempered, she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\\rkind of rule, and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes\\rthem bitterandand barleysugar and such things that make children\\rsweettempered. I only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be\\rso stingy about it, you know\\r\\rShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\\rstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. Youre thinking\\rabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I cant\\rtell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\\ra bit.\\r\\rPerhaps it hasnt one, Alice ventured to remark.\\r\\rTut, tut, child! said the Duchess. Everythings got a moral, if only\\ryou can find it. And she squeezed herself up closer to Alices side as\\rshe spoke.\\r\\rAlice did not much like keeping so close to her first, because the\\rDuchess was very ugly and secondly, because she was exactly the\\rright height to rest her chin upon Alices shoulder, and it was an\\runcomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\\rbore it as well as she could.\\r\\rThe games going on rather better now, she said, by way of keeping up\\rthe conversation a little.\\r\\rTis so, said the Duchess and the moral of that isOh, tis love,\\rtis love, that makes the world go round!\\r\\rSomebody said, Alice whispered, that its done by everybody minding\\rtheir own business!\\r\\rAh, well! It means much the same thing, said the Duchess, digging her\\rsharp little chin into Alices shoulder as she added, and the moral of\\rthat isTake care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\\rthemselves.\\r\\rHow fond she is of finding morals in things! Alice thought to\\rherself.\\r\\rI dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your waist,\\rthe Duchess said after a pause the reason is, that Im doubtful about\\rthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment\\r\\rHe might bite, Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\\rto have the experiment tried.\\r\\rVery true, said the Duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\\rthe moral of that isBirds of a feather flock together.\\r\\rOnly mustard isnt a bird, Alice remarked.\\r\\rRight, as usual, said the Duchess what a clear way you have of\\rputting things!\\r\\rIts a mineral, I think, said Alice.\\r\\rOf course it is, said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\\reverything that Alice said theres a large mustardmine near here.\\rAnd the moral of that isThe more there is of mine, the less there is\\rof yours.\\r\\rOh, I know! exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\\rremark, its a vegetable. It doesnt look like one, but it is.\\r\\rI quite agree with you, said the Duchess and the moral of that\\risBe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more\\rsimplyNever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\rappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\\rotherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\\rotherwise.\\r\\rI think I should understand that better, Alice said very politely,\\rif I had it written down but I cant quite follow it as you say it.\\r\\rThats nothing to what I could say if I chose, the Duchess replied,\\rin a pleased tone.\\r\\rPray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that, said\\rAlice.\\r\\rOh, dont talk about trouble! said the Duchess. I make you a present\\rof everything Ive said as yet.\\r\\rA cheap sort of present! thought Alice. Im glad they dont give\\rbirthday presents like that! But she did not venture to say it out\\rloud.\\r\\rThinking again the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\\rlittle chin.\\r\\rIve a right to think, said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\\rfeel a little worried.\\r\\rJust about as much right, said the Duchess, as pigs have to fly and\\rthe m\\r\\rBut here, to Alices great surprise, the Duchesss voice died away,\\reven in the middle of her favourite word moral, and the arm that was\\rlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\\rQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\\rthunderstorm.\\r\\rA fine day, your Majesty! the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\\r\\rNow, I give you fair warning, shouted the Queen, stamping on the\\rground as she spoke either you or your head must be off, and that in\\rabout half no time! Take your choice!\\r\\rThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\\r\\rLets go on with the game, the Queen said to Alice and Alice was too\\rmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\rcroquetground.\\r\\rThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence, and were\\rresting in the shade however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\\rback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moments delay\\rwould cost them their lives.\\r\\rAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\\rwith the other players, and shouting Off with his head! or Off with\\rher head! Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\\rsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\\rthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\\rall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\\rand under sentence of execution.\\r\\rThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, Have\\ryou seen the Mock Turtle yet\\r\\rNo, said Alice. I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is.\\r\\rIts the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from, said the Queen.\\r\\rI never saw one, or heard of one, said Alice.\\r\\rCome on, then, said the Queen, and he shall tell you his history,\\r\\rAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\\rto the company generally, You are all pardoned. Come, thats a\\rgood thing! she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\rnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\\r\\rThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. If\\ryou dont know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture. Up, lazy\\rthing! said the Queen, and take this young lady to see the Mock\\rTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\\rexecutions I have ordered and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\\rwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\\rbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\\ras to go after that savage Queen so she waited.\\r\\rThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the Queen till\\rshe was out of sight then it chuckled. What fun! said the Gryphon,\\rhalf to itself, half to Alice.\\r\\rWhat is the fun said Alice.\\r\\rWhy, she, said the Gryphon. Its all her fancy, that they never\\rexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!\\r\\rEverybody says come on! here, thought Alice, as she went slowly\\rafter it I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\\r\\rThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\rsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\rnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\\rpitied him deeply. What is his sorrow she asked the Gryphon, and the\\rGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, Its all\\rhis fancy, that he hasnt got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\\r\\rSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\rfull of tears, but said nothing.\\r\\rThis here young lady, said the Gryphon, she wants for to know your\\rhistory, she do.\\r\\rIll tell it her, said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone sit\\rdown, both of you, and dont speak a word till Ive finished.\\r\\rSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\\rherself, I dont see how he can ever finish, if he doesnt begin.\\rBut she waited patiently.\\r\\rOnce, said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, I was a real\\rTurtle.\\r\\rThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\roccasional exclamation of Hjckrrh! from the Gryphon, and the constant\\rheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\\rsaying, Thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not\\rhelp thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said\\rnothing.\\r\\rWhen we were little, the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\rthough still sobbing a little now and then, we went to school in the\\rsea. The master was an old Turtlewe used to call him Tortoise\\r\\rWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasnt one Alice asked.\\r\\rWe called him Tortoise because he taught us, said the Mock Turtle\\rangrily really you are very dull!\\r\\rYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\\rquestion, added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked\\rat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\\rGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, Drive on, old fellow! Dont be all\\rday about it! and he went on in these words\\r\\rYes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynt believe it\\r\\rI never said I didnt! interrupted Alice.\\r\\rYou did, said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\rHold your tongue! added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\\rThe Mock Turtle went on.\\r\\rWe had the best of educationsin fact, we went to school every day\\r\\rIve been to a dayschool, too, said Alice you neednt be so\\rproud as all that.\\r\\rWith extras asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\\r\\rYes, said Alice, we learned French and music.\\r\\rAnd washing said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\rCertainly not! said Alice indignantly.\\r\\rAh! then yours wasnt a really good school, said the Mock Turtle in a\\rtone of great relief. Now at ours they had at the end of the bill,\\rFrench, music, and washingextra.\\r\\rYou couldnt have wanted it much, said Alice living at the bottom\\rof the sea.\\r\\rI couldnt afford to learn it. said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. I\\ronly took the regular course.\\r\\rWhat was that inquired Alice.\\r\\rReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with, the Mock Turtle\\rreplied and then the different branches of ArithmeticAmbition,\\rDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.\\r\\rI never heard of Uglification, Alice ventured to say. What is it\\r\\rThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. What! Never heard of\\ruglifying! it exclaimed. You know what to beautify is, I suppose\\r\\rYes, said Alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanythingprettier.\\r\\rWell, then, the Gryphon went on, if you dont know what to uglify\\ris, you are a simpleton.\\r\\rAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\\rshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said What else had you to learn\\r\\rWell, there was Mystery, the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\\rsubjects on his flappers, Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\rSeaography then Drawlingthe Drawlingmaster was an old congereel,\\rthat used to come once a week he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\rFainting in Coils.\\r\\rWhat was that like said Alice.\\r\\rWell, I cant show it you myself, the Mock Turtle said Im too\\rstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\\r\\rHadnt time, said the Gryphon I went to the Classics master,\\rthough. He was an old crab, he was.\\r\\rI never went to him, the Mock Turtle said with a sigh he taught\\rLaughing and Grief, they used to say.\\r\\rSo he did, so he did, said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn and both\\rcreatures hid their faces in their paws.\\r\\rAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons said Alice, in a hurry\\rto change the subject.\\r\\rTen hours the first day, said the Mock Turtle nine the next, and so\\ron.\\r\\rWhat a curious plan! exclaimed Alice.\\r\\rThats the reason theyre called lessons, the Gryphon remarked\\rbecause they lessen from day to day.\\r\\rThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\\rbefore she made her next remark. Then the eleventh day must have been\\ra holiday\\r\\rOf course it was, said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\rAnd how did you manage on the twelfth Alice went on eagerly.\\r\\rThats enough about lessons, the Gryphon interrupted in a very\\rdecided tone tell her something about the games now.\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER X.\\rThe Lobster Quadrille\\r\\r\\rThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\\rhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\rtwo sobs choked his voice. Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\\rsaid the Gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\rthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\rrunning down his cheeks, he went on again\\r\\rYou may not have lived much under the sea I havent, said\\rAliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\\rAlice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily, and\\rsaid No, never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\rLobster Quadrille is!\\r\\rNo, indeed, said Alice. What sort of a dance is it\\r\\rWhy, said the Gryphon, you first form into a line along the\\rseashore\\r\\rTwo lines! cried the Mock Turtle. Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on\\rthen, when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of the way\\r\\rThat generally takes some time, interrupted the Gryphon.\\r\\ryou advance twice\\r\\rEach with a lobster as a partner! cried the Gryphon.\\r\\rOf course, the Mock Turtle said advance twice, set to partners\\r\\rchange lobsters, and retire in same order, continued the Gryphon.\\r\\rThen, you know, the Mock Turtle went on, you throw the\\r\\rThe lobsters! shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\r\\ras far out to sea as you can\\r\\rSwim after them! screamed the Gryphon.\\r\\rTurn a somersault in the sea! cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\rabout.\\r\\rChange lobsters again! yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\r\\rBack to land again, and thats all the first figure, said the Mock\\rTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures, who had\\rbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\\rsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\\r\\rIt must be a very pretty dance, said Alice timidly.\\r\\rWould you like to see a little of it said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\rVery much indeed, said Alice.\\r\\rCome, lets try the first figure! said the Mock Turtle to the\\rGryphon. We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing\\r\\rOh, you sing, said the Gryphon. Ive forgotten the words.\\r\\rSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\rthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\rforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\rand sadly\\r\\rWill you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail.\\rTheres a porpoise close behind us, and hes treading on my tail.\\rSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\rThey are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance\\rWill you, wont you, will you, wont you, will you join the dance\\rWill you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the dance\\r\\rYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\rWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\\rBut the snail replied Too far, too far! and gave a look askance\\rSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\rWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\rWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\r\\rWhat matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied.\\rThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\rThe further off from England the nearer is to France\\rThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\rWill you, wont you, will you, wont you, will you join the dance\\rWill you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the dance\\r\\r\\rThank you, its a very interesting dance to watch, said Alice,\\rfeeling very glad that it was over at last and I do so like that\\rcurious song about the whiting!\\r\\rOh, as to the whiting, said the Mock Turtle, theyyouve seen them,\\rof course\\r\\rYes, said Alice, Ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself\\rhastily.\\r\\rI dont know where Dinn may be, said the Mock Turtle, but if youve\\rseen them so often, of course you know what theyre like.\\r\\rI believe so, Alice replied thoughtfully. They have their tails in\\rtheir mouthsand theyre all over crumbs.\\r\\rYoure wrong about the crumbs, said the Mock Turtle crumbs would\\rall wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths\\rand the reason is here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\\reyes.Tell her about the reason and all that, he said to the Gryphon.\\r\\rThe reason is, said the Gryphon, that they would go with the\\rlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\\rfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\\rcouldnt get them out again. Thats all.\\r\\rThank you, said Alice, its very interesting. I never knew so much\\rabout a whiting before.\\r\\rI can tell you more than that, if you like, said the Gryphon. Do you\\rknow why its called a whiting\\r\\rI never thought about it, said Alice. Why\\r\\rIt does the boots and shoes, the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\r\\rAlice was thoroughly puzzled. Does the boots and shoes! she repeated\\rin a wondering tone.\\r\\rWhy, what are your shoes done with said the Gryphon. I mean, what\\rmakes them so shiny\\r\\rAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\ranswer. Theyre done with blacking, I believe.\\r\\rBoots and shoes under the sea, the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\rare done with a whiting. Now you know.\\r\\rAnd what are they made of Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\r\\rSoles and eels, of course, the Gryphon replied rather impatiently\\rany shrimp could have told you that.\\r\\rIf Id been the whiting, said Alice, whose thoughts were still\\rrunning on the song, Id have said to the porpoise, Keep back,\\rplease we dont want you with us!\\r\\rThey were obliged to have him with them, the Mock Turtle said no\\rwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\\r\\rWouldnt it really said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\r\\rOf course not, said the Mock Turtle why, if a fish came to me,\\rand told me he was going a journey, I should say With what porpoise\\r\\rDont you mean purpose said Alice.\\r\\rI mean what I say, the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\\rthe Gryphon added Come, lets hear some of your adventures.\\r\\rI could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning, said\\rAlice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday,\\rbecause I was a different person then.\\r\\rExplain all that, said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\rNo, no! The adventures first, said the Gryphon in an impatient tone\\rexplanations take such a dreadful time.\\r\\rSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\rsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\rthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\rtheir eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she\\rwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\\rabout her repeating You are old, Father William, to the\\rCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\\rTurtle drew a long breath, and said Thats very curious.\\r\\rIts all about as curious as it can be, said the Gryphon.\\r\\rIt all came different! the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. I\\rshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\\rbegin. He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\rauthority over Alice.\\r\\rStand up and repeat Tis the voice of the sluggard, said the\\rGryphon.\\r\\rHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\\rthought Alice I might as well be at school at once. However, she got\\rup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\rQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\rvery queer indeed\\r\\rTis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare,\\rYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\\rAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\\rTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\\r\\rlater editions continued as follows\\rWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\\rAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\\rBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\\rHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.\\r\\r\\rThats different from what I used to say when I was a child, said\\rthe Gryphon.\\r\\rWell, I never heard it before, said the Mock Turtle but it sounds\\runcommon nonsense.\\r\\rAlice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands,\\rwondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.\\r\\rI should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\rShe cant explain it, said the Gryphon hastily. Go on with the next\\rverse.\\r\\rBut about his toes the Mock Turtle persisted. How could he turn\\rthem out with his nose, you know\\r\\rIts the first position in dancing. Alice said but was dreadfully\\rpuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\r\\rGo on with the next verse, the Gryphon repeated impatiently it\\rbegins I passed by his garden.\\r\\rAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\\rwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice\\r\\rI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\\rHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\\r\\rlater editions continued as follows\\rThe Panther took piecrust, and gravy, and meat,\\rWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\rWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\\rWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon\\rWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\\rAnd concluded the banquet\\r\\r\\rWhat is the use of repeating all that stuff, the Mock Turtle\\rinterrupted, if you dont explain it as you go on Its by far the\\rmost confusing thing I ever heard!\\r\\rYes, I think youd better leave off, said the Gryphon and Alice was\\ronly too glad to do so.\\r\\rShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille the Gryphon\\rwent on. Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song\\r\\rOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind, Alice\\rreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\\rHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her Turtle Soup, will you, old\\rfellow\\r\\rThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\\rwith sobs, to sing this\\r\\rBeautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\rWaiting in a hot tureen!\\rWho for such dainties would not stoop\\rSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\rSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\r Beauootiful Soooop!\\r Beauootiful Soooop!\\rSoooop of the eeevening,\\r Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\r\\rBeautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\\rGame, or any other dish\\rWho would not give all else for two p\\rennyworth only of beautiful Soup\\rPennyworth only of beautiful Soup\\r Beauootiful Soooop!\\r Beauootiful Soooop!\\rSoooop of the eeevening,\\r Beautiful, beautiFUL SOUP!\\r\\r\\rChorus again! cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\\rto repeat it, when a cry of The trials beginning! was heard in the\\rdistance.\\r\\rCome on! cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\\roff, without waiting for the end of the song.\\r\\rWhat trial is it Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon only\\ranswered Come on! and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\\rcame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words\\r\\rSoooop of the eeevening,\\r Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER XI.\\rWho Stole the Tarts\\r\\r\\rThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\rarrived, with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little\\rbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards the Knave was\\rstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\rhim and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\\rhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\\rcourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so\\rgood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd\\rget the trial done, she thought, and hand round the refreshments!\\rBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\\reverything about her, to pass away the time.\\r\\rAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\\rabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\rthe name of nearly everything there. Thats the judge, she said to\\rherself, because of his great wig.\\r\\rThe judge, by the way, was the King and as he wore his crown over the\\rwig, look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it, he\\rdid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\r\\rAnd thats the jurybox, thought Alice, and those twelve creatures,\\rshe was obliged to say creatures, you see, because some of them were\\ranimals, and some were birds, I suppose they are the jurors. She\\rsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\\rproud of it for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\\rgirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, jurymen\\rwould have done just as well.\\r\\rThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. What are\\rthey doing Alice whispered to the Gryphon. They cant have anything\\rto put down yet, before the trials begun.\\r\\rTheyre putting down their names, the Gryphon whispered in reply,\\rfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\\r\\rStupid things! Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\\rstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, Silence in the\\rcourt! and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\\rto make out who was talking.\\r\\rAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\\rthat all the jurors were writing down stupid things! on their slates,\\rand she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell\\rstupid, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. A nice\\rmuddle their slatesll be in before the trials over! thought Alice.\\r\\rOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\\rcould not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\\rvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\\rthat the poor little juror it was Bill, the Lizard could not make out\\rat all what had become of it so, after hunting all about for it, he\\rwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this\\rwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\\r\\rHerald, read the accusation! said the King.\\r\\rOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\\runrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows\\r\\rThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\r All on a summer day\\rThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\\r And took them quite away!\\r\\r\\rConsider your verdict, the King said to the jury.\\r\\rNot yet, not yet! the Rabbit hastily interrupted. Theres a great\\rdeal to come before that!\\r\\rCall the first witness, said the King and the White Rabbit blew\\rthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, First witness!\\r\\rThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\\rand a piece of breadandbutter in the other. I beg pardon, your\\rMajesty, he began, for bringing these in but I hadnt quite finished\\rmy tea when I was sent for.\\r\\rYou ought to have finished, said the King. When did you begin\\r\\rThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\\rcourt, arminarm with the Dormouse. Fourteenth of March, I think it\\rwas, he said.\\r\\rFifteenth, said the March Hare.\\r\\rSixteenth, added the Dormouse.\\r\\rWrite that down, the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\\rwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\\rreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\\r\\rTake off your hat, the King said to the Hatter.\\r\\rIt isnt mine, said the Hatter.\\r\\rStolen! the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\\ra memorandum of the fact.\\r\\rI keep them to sell, the Hatter added as an explanation Ive none\\rof my own. Im a hatter.\\r\\rHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\\rwho turned pale and fidgeted.\\r\\rGive your evidence, said the King and dont be nervous, or Ill\\rhave you executed on the spot.\\r\\rThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting\\rfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\\rconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\rbreadandbutter.\\r\\rJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\rher a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to\\rgrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\rthe court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\\ras long as there was room for her.\\r\\rI wish you wouldnt squeeze so. said the Dormouse, who was sitting\\rnext to her. I can hardly breathe.\\r\\rI cant help it, said Alice very meekly Im growing.\\r\\rYouve no right to grow here, said the Dormouse.\\r\\rDont talk nonsense, said Alice more boldly you know youre growing\\rtoo.\\r\\rYes, but I grow at a reasonable pace, said the Dormouse not in\\rthat ridiculous fashion. And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\\rto the other side of the court.\\r\\rAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\rjust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\rof the court, Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\\ron which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\\roff.\\r\\rGive your evidence, the King repeated angrily, or Ill have you\\rexecuted, whether youre nervous or not.\\r\\rIm a poor man, your Majesty, the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\rand I hadnt begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the\\rbreadandbutter getting so thinand the twinkling of the tea\\r\\rThe twinkling of the what said the King.\\r\\rIt began with the tea, the Hatter replied.\\r\\rOf course twinkling begins with a T! said the King sharply. Do you\\rtake me for a dunce Go on!\\r\\rIm a poor man, the Hatter went on, and most things twinkled after\\rthatonly the March Hare said\\r\\rI didnt! the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\\r\\rYou did! said the Hatter.\\r\\rI deny it! said the March Hare.\\r\\rHe denies it, said the King leave out that part.\\r\\rWell, at any rate, the Dormouse said the Hatter went on, looking\\ranxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the Dormouse denied\\rnothing, being fast asleep.\\r\\rAfter that, continued the Hatter, I cut some more breadandbutter\\r\\rBut what did the Dormouse say one of the jury asked.\\r\\rThat I cant remember, said the Hatter.\\r\\rYou must remember, remarked the King, or Ill have you executed.\\r\\rThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter, and went\\rdown on one knee. Im a poor man, your Majesty, he began.\\r\\rYoure a very poor speaker, said the King.\\r\\rHere one of the guineapigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\rthe officers of the court. As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\rexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\rup at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig,\\rhead first, and then sat upon it.\\r\\rIm glad Ive seen that done, thought Alice. Ive so often read in\\rthe newspapers, at the end of trials, There was some attempts at\\rapplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\rcourt, and I never understood what it meant till now.\\r\\rIf thats all you know about it, you may stand down, continued the\\rKing.\\r\\rI cant go no lower, said the Hatter Im on the floor, as it is.\\r\\rThen you may sit down, the King replied.\\r\\rHere the other guineapig cheered, and was suppressed.\\r\\rCome, that finished the guineapigs! thought Alice. Now we shall get\\ron better.\\r\\rId rather finish my tea, said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\\rthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\\r\\rYou may go, said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\\rwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\\r\\rand just take his head off outside, the Queen added to one of the\\rofficers but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\rto the door.\\r\\rCall the next witness! said the King.\\r\\rThe next witness was the Duchesss cook. She carried the pepperbox in\\rher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\rcourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\r\\rGive your evidence, said the King.\\r\\rShant, said the cook.\\r\\rThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\rYour Majesty must crossexamine this witness.\\r\\rWell, if I must, I must, the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\\rafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\rnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, What are tarts made of\\r\\rPepper, mostly, said the cook.\\r\\rTreacle, said a sleepy voice behind her.\\r\\rCollar that Dormouse, the Queen shrieked out. Behead that Dormouse!\\rTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\\rwhiskers!\\r\\rFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\\rturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\\rdisappeared.\\r\\rNever mind! said the King, with an air of great relief. Call the\\rnext witness. And he added in an undertone to the Queen, Really, my\\rdear, you must crossexamine the next witness. It quite makes my\\rforehead ache!\\r\\rAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\\rvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, for they\\rhavent got much evidence yet, she said to herself. Imagine her\\rsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\\rlittle voice, the name Alice!\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rCHAPTER XII.\\rAlices Evidence\\r\\r\\rHere! cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\rlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\ra hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt,\\rupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\rthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\\rgoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\\r\\rOh, I beg your pardon! she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\rbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\\rof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\\ridea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\\rjurybox, or they would die.\\r\\rThe trial cannot proceed, said the King in a very grave voice, until\\rall the jurymen are back in their proper placesall, he repeated\\rwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\\r\\rAlice looked at the jurybox, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\\rthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\\rtail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\\rgot it out again, and put it right not that it signifies much, she\\rsaid to herself I should think it would be quite as much use in the\\rtrial one way up as the other.\\r\\rAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\rupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\rthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\raccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\ranything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\rcourt.\\r\\rWhat do you know about this business the King said to Alice.\\r\\rNothing, said Alice.\\r\\rNothing whatever persisted the King.\\r\\rNothing whatever, said Alice.\\r\\rThats very important, the King said, turning to the jury. They were\\rjust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\\rRabbit interrupted Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course, he\\rsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\\rhe spoke.\\r\\rUnimportant, of course, I meant, the King hastily said, and went on\\rto himself in an undertone,\\r\\rimportantunimportantunimportantimportant as if he were trying\\rwhich word sounded best.\\r\\rSome of the jury wrote it down important, and some unimportant.\\rAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates\\rbut it doesnt matter a bit, she thought to herself.\\r\\rAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\rhis notebook, cackled out Silence! and read out from his book, Rule\\rFortytwo. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.\\r\\rEverybody looked at Alice.\\r\\rIm not a mile high, said Alice.\\r\\rYou are, said the King.\\r\\rNearly two miles high, added the Queen.\\r\\rWell, I shant go, at any rate, said Alice besides, thats not a\\rregular rule you invented it just now.\\r\\rIts the oldest rule in the book, said the King.\\r\\rThen it ought to be Number One, said Alice.\\r\\rThe King turned pale, and shut his notebook hastily. Consider your\\rverdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\r\\rTheres more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty, said the\\rWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been\\rpicked up.\\r\\rWhats in it said the Queen.\\r\\rI havent opened it yet, said the White Rabbit, but it seems to be a\\rletter, written by the prisoner toto somebody.\\r\\rIt must have been that, said the King, unless it was written to\\rnobody, which isnt usual, you know.\\r\\rWho is it directed to said one of the jurymen.\\r\\rIt isnt directed at all, said the White Rabbit in fact, theres\\rnothing written on the outside. He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\\rand added It isnt a letter, after all its a set of verses.\\r\\rAre they in the prisoners handwriting asked another of the jurymen.\\r\\rNo, theyre not, said the White Rabbit, and thats the queerest\\rthing about it. The jury all looked puzzled.\\r\\rHe must have imitated somebody elses hand, said the King. The jury\\rall brightened up again.\\r\\rPlease your Majesty, said the Knave, I didnt write it, and they\\rcant prove I did theres no name signed at the end.\\r\\rIf you didnt sign it, said the King, that only makes the matter\\rworse. You must have meant some mischief, or else youd have signed\\ryour name like an honest man.\\r\\rThere was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really\\rclever thing the King had said that day.\\r\\rThat proves his guilt, said the Queen.\\r\\rIt proves nothing of the sort! said Alice. Why, you dont even know\\rwhat theyre about!\\r\\rRead them, said the King.\\r\\rThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. Where shall I begin, please\\ryour Majesty he asked.\\r\\rBegin at the beginning, the King said gravely, and go on till you\\rcome to the end then stop.\\r\\rThese were the verses the White Rabbit read\\r\\rThey told me you had been to her,\\r And mentioned me to him\\rShe gave me a good character,\\r But said I could not swim.\\r\\rHe sent them word I had not gone\\r We know it to be true\\rIf she should push the matter on,\\r What would become of you\\r\\rI gave her one, they gave him two,\\r You gave us three or more\\rThey all returned from him to you,\\r Though they were mine before.\\r\\rIf I or she should chance to be\\r Involved in this affair,\\rHe trusts to you to set them free,\\r Exactly as we were.\\r\\rMy notion was that you had been\\r Before she had this fit\\rAn obstacle that came between\\r Him, and ourselves, and it.\\r\\rDont let him know she liked them best,\\r For this must ever be\\rA secret, kept from all the rest,\\r Between yourself and me.\\r\\r\\rThats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet, said the\\rKing, rubbing his hands so now let the jury\\r\\rIf any one of them can explain it, said Alice, she had grown so\\rlarge in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of\\rinterrupting him, Ill give him sixpence. I dont believe theres\\ran atom of meaning in it.\\r\\rThe jury all wrote down on their slates, She doesnt believe theres\\ran atom of meaning in it, but none of them attempted to explain the\\rpaper.\\r\\rIf theres no meaning in it, said the King, that saves a world of\\rtrouble, you know, as we neednt try to find any. And yet I dont\\rknow, he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\\rthem with one eye I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\\rsaid I could not swim you cant swim, can you he added, turning\\rto the Knave.\\r\\rThe Knave shook his head sadly. Do I look like it he said. Which he\\rcertainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.\\r\\rAll right, so far, said the King, and he went on muttering over the\\rverses to himself We know it to be true thats the jury, of\\rcourseI gave her one, they gave him two why, that must be what he\\rdid with the tarts, you know\\r\\rBut, it goes on they all returned from him to you, said Alice.\\r\\rWhy, there they are! said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\\rtarts on the table. Nothing can be clearer than that. Then\\ragainbefore she had this fit you never had fits, my dear, I\\rthink he said to the Queen.\\r\\rNever! said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\ras she spoke. The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\rslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark but he now hastily\\rbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\\ras it lasted.\\r\\rThen the words dont fit you, said the King, looking round the\\rcourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\\r\\rIts a pun! the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\\rlaughed, Let the jury consider their verdict, the King said, for\\rabout the twentieth time that day.\\r\\rNo, no! said the Queen. Sentence firstverdict afterwards.\\r\\rStuff and nonsense! said Alice loudly. The idea of having the\\rsentence first!\\r\\rHold your tongue! said the Queen, turning purple.\\r\\rI wont! said Alice.\\r\\rOff with her head! the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\rmoved.\\r\\rWho cares for you said Alice, she had grown to her full size by\\rthis time. Youre nothing but a pack of cards!\\r\\rAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\rher she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\rtried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\rhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\rleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\r\\rWake up, Alice dear! said her sister Why, what a long sleep youve\\rhad!\\r\\rOh, Ive had such a curious dream! said Alice, and she told her\\rsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\\rAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she\\rhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, It was a curious\\rdream, dear, certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late.\\rSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\rwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\\r\\r\\rBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\rhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\\rher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\\rand this was her dream\\r\\rFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\rhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\\rlooking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice, and\\rsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\\rthat would always get into her eyesand still as she listened, or\\rseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\\rstrange creatures of her little sisters dream.\\r\\rThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried bythe\\rfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe\\rcould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\rshared their neverending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\rordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pigbaby\\rwas sneezing on the Duchesss knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\raround itonce more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\rLizards slatepencil, and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs,\\rfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\rTurtle.\\r\\rSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\rWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\rwould change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the\\rwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling\\rteacups would change to tinkling sheepbells, and the Queens shrill\\rcries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby, the\\rshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\\rshe knew to the confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the\\rlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\\rTurtles heavy sobs.\\r\\rLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\rwould, in the aftertime, be herself a grown woman and how she would\\rkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\rchildhood and how she would gather about her other little children,\\rand make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\\rperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago and how she\\rwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\\rtheir simple joys, remembering her own childlife, and the happy summer\\rdays.\\r\\rTHE END \\r\\r\\r\\r\\rEnd of Project Gutenbergs Alices Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll\\r\\r END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICES ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND \\r\\r This file should be named .txt or .zip \\rThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in\\r httpwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\rProduced by Arthur DiBianca and David Widger\\r\\rUpdated editions will replace the previous onethe old editions will\\rbe renamed.\\r\\rCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\rlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\rso the Foundation and you! can copy and distribute it in the United\\rStates without permission and without paying copyright\\rroyalties.
